  # Ad-hoc signed (not notarized): strip the quarantine Homebrew stamps on, so
  # Gatekeeper doesn't block first launch. Safe for a self-built personal tool.

  caveats <<~EOS
    ClaudeGauge is an unofficial, ad-hoc-signed personal tool.
    First launch: it lives in the menu bar (no Dock icon). Open the menu and
    choose "Log in..." to authorize with your Claude account.
